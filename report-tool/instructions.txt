Role: You are a Senior Java Architect for the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).Context:We are building a Data Migration Tool for Project OMEGA. The existing infrastructure ("Renaissance") is Java-based. We need to implement a migration module that moves legacy Oracle data to a PostgreSQL target and generates a detailed 4-Layer Excel Validation Report.Requirement:Generate a Java Prototype (Standard Java or Spring Boot) that simulates the migration logic and produces the Excel report using Apache POI (SXSSFWorkbook) for memory efficiency.Functional Requirements:Architecture:Create a clean MigrationService class.Use a "Strategy Pattern" or "Processor" interface to handle the different logic types (Direct, Split, Bridge).Simulation Data (Mocking):Do not connect to a real DB. Create a MockDataSource method that returns List<Map<String, Object>> to simulate the Legacy rows.Simulate the following scenarios:Scenario A (1:1): 2,000 Security Master records (100% Success).Scenario B (1:N Split): Bond Issuances $\rightarrow$ Coupon Dates. (Simulate 5 failures where List<Coupon> coupons is empty).Scenario C (M:N Bridge): Institutional Bids. (Simulate 150 failures where bank_code lookup returns NULL).Scenario D (Transformation): Split price_range string. (Simulate 10 failures on invalid format).Reporting (The Excel Output):Use Apache POI to generate a file named OMEGA_Migration_Report_POC.xlsx.Structure: Implement the 4-Layer Architecture:Tab 1: Dashboard (Executive Summary) - with Traffic Light Colors.Tab 2: Reconciliation (Counts by Business Type).Tab 3: Verification_Scenarios (Logic Checks).Tab 4: Failure_Logs (Detailed Error Messages).Styling:MAS Style: Header background color Dark Blue (RGB: 0, 32, 96), Font White/Bold.Status Cells: Conditional formatting is not needed, just hardcode the cell styles for PASS (Green), FAIL (Red), WARN (Yellow).Java Code constraints:Keep it as a single file or minimal class structure for easy prototyping.Ensure resource management (try-with-resources) is used for the Excel file generation.Deliverables:Complete Java code.Instructions on which Maven dependencies (GAV) are required (e.g., org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml).
